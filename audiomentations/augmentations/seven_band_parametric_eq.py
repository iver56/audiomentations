class SevenBandParametricEQ(BaseWaveformTransform):
    """
    Adjust the volume of different frequency bands. This transform is a 7-band
    parametric equalizer - a combination of one low shelf filter, five peaking filters
    and one high shelf filter, all with randomized gains, Q values and center frequencies.

    Because this transform changes the timbre, but keeps the overall "class" of the
    sound the same (depending on application), it can be used for data augmentation to
    make ML models more robust to various frequency spectrums. Many things can affect
    the spectrum, like room acoustics, any objects between the microphone and
    the sound source, microphone type/model and the distance between the sound source
    and the microphone.

    The seven bands have center frequencies picked in the following ranges (min-max):
    42-95 hz
    91-204 hz
    196-441 hz
    421-948 hz
    909-2045 hz
    1957-4404 hz
    4216-9486 hz
