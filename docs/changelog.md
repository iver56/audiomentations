# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.43.0] - 2025-09-09

### Changed

* Make `LoudnessNormalization` **400% faster** by switching from pyloudnorm to the new and faster alternative [loudness](https://github.com/iver56/loudness) 
* Improve `AddBackgroundNoise` performance: Only load/decode the part of the noise file that is needed, instead of the entire file.
* Bump min Python version to 3.10
* Switch to a more modern type hint style

### Deprecated

* Deprecate `"pydub"` backend in `Mp3Compression`, because pydub isn't maintained anymore, and depends on audioop, which got removed in Python 3.13. The recommended alternative is `"fast-mp3-augment"`

### Removed

* Remove upper Python version limit to avoid hindering early adopters
* Remove LRU cache in `AddBackgroundNoise`

## [0.42.0] - 2025-07-04

### Added

* Add support for Python 3.13
* Add support for librosa 0.11.0

### Changed

* Make `Mp3Compression` **25-300% faster** (depending on hardware, audio properties like duration and number of channels and various params, like bitrate) with the new `backend="fast-mp3-augment"` (now default). The extra dependency for this is [fast-mp3-augment :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/iver56/fast-mp3-augment){target=_blank}, which pulls a few useful tricks for faster execution. 
* Make `Limiter` **30% faster** and easier to install (extra dependency is now [numpy-audio-limiter :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/iver56/numpy-audio-limiter){target=_blank} instead of [cylimiter :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/pzelasko/cylimiter/){target=_blank}). The `Limiter` behavior has not changed, although there are minor numerical differences.

### Fixed

* Handle non-contiguous audio ndarray input to `PitchShift` and `TimeStretch` properly

## [0.41.0] - 2025-05-05

### Added

* Add support for NumPy 2.x
* Add `weights` parameter to `OneOf`. This lets you guide the probability of each transform being chosen.

### Changed

* Improve type hints

#### :warning: The `TimeMask` transform has been changed significantly:

* **Breaking change**: Remove `fade` parameter. `fade_duration=0.0` now denotes disabled fading.
* Enable fading by default
* Apply a smooth fade curve instead of a linear one
* Add `mask_location` parameter
* Change the default value of `min_band_part` from 0.0 to 0.01
* Change the default value of `max_band_part` from 0.5 to 0.2
* ~50% faster

The following examples show how you can adapt your code when upgrading from <=v0.40.0 to >=v0.41.0:

| <= 0.40.0                                                    | >= 0.41.0                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TimeMask(min_band_part=0.1, max_band_part=0.15, fade=True)` | `TimeMask(min_band_part=0.1, max_band_part=0.15, fade_duration=0.01)` |
| `TimeMask()`                                                 | `TimeMask(min_band_part=0.0, max_band_part=0.5, fade_duration=0.0)`   |

### Removed

* `SpecCompose`, `SpecChannelShuffle` and `SpecFrequencyMask` have been removed. You can read more about this here: [#391](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations/pull/391)

## [0.40.0] - 2025-03-20

### Added

* Add support for scipy>=1.13

### Changed

* Lay the groundwork for NumPy 2.x support (version constraint update coming in the next release)
* Speed up `LoudnessNormalization` by ~20%
* Improve test coverage and documentation
* Bump min `python-stretch` version and remove the limitation on the number of channels in `PitchShift`
* Bump min numpy version to 1.22
* Bump min pyroomacoustics version to 0.7.4

### Fixed

* Fix a bug where `TimeMask` could raise an exception if the fade length became 0
* Disallow `min_cutoff_freq` <= 0 in `HighPassFilter`
* Make `AdjustDuration` picklable (useful for multiprocessing)

### Removed

* Remove support for Python 3.8

## [0.39.0] - 2025-02-12

### Changed

* Place an upper distance limit of 2500 meters in `AirAbsorption` in order to avoid numerical issues
* Expand the allowed shift range in `PitchShift` from [-12, 12] to [-24, 24]
* Switch to a higher quality method, `"signalsmith_stretch"`, in `PitchShift` and `TimeStretch`. It sounds significantly
  better (e.g. less smearing) and is 50-100% faster than `"librosa_phase_vocoder"`

If you want to keep using the old method, `"librosa_phase_vocoder"`, it can be done like this:

```
PitchShift(method="librosa_phase_vocoder")
TimeStretch(method="librosa_phase_vocoder")
```

### Fixed

* Fix a bug where `AddShortNoises(include_silence_in_noise_rms_estimation=False)` sometimes raised a `ValueError` due to
  digital silence in a portion of a short noise. This bug was introduced in v0.36.1.

## [0.38.0] - 2024-12-06

### Added

* Add/improve parameter validation in `AddGaussianSNR`, `GainTransition`, `LoudnessNormalization` and `AddShortNoises`
* Add/update type hints for consistency
* Add human-readable string representation of audiomentations class instances

### Changed

* Improve documentation with respect to consistency, clarity and grammar
* Adjust Python version compatibility range, so all patches of Python 3.12 are supported

### Removed

* Remove deprecated *_in_db args
  in [Gain](../waveform_transforms/gain/), [AddBackgroundNoise](../waveform_transforms/add_background_noise/), [AddGaussianSNR](../waveform_transforms/add_gaussian_snr/), [GainTransition](../waveform_transforms/gain_transition/), [LoudnessNormalization](../waveform_transforms/loudness_normalization/)
  and [AddShortNoises](../waveform_transforms/add_short_noises/). Those args were deprecated since v0.31.0, and now they
  are gone. For details, check the documentation page of each transform.

For example:

| Old (deprecated since v0.31.0) | New                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `Gain(min_gain_in_db=-12.0)`   | `Gain(min_gain_db=-12.0)` |

### Fixed

* Fix a bug where `AirAbsorption` often chose the wrong humidity bucket
* Fix wrong logic in validation check of relation between `crossfade_duration` and `min_part_duration` in `RepeatPart`
* Fix default value of `max_absolute_rms_db` in `AddBackgroundNoises`. It was incorrectly set to -45.0, but is now
  -15.0. This bug was introduced in v0.31.0.
* Fix various errors in the documentation of `AddShortNoises` and `AirAbsorption`
* Fix a bug where `AddShortNoises` sometimes raised a `ValueError` because of an empty array. This bug was introduced in
  v0.36.1.

## [0.37.0] - 2024-09-03

### Changed

* Leverage the SIMD-accelerated [numpy-minmax](https://github.com/nomonosound/numpy-minmax) package for speed
  improvements. These transforms are faster now: `Limiter`, `Mp3Compression` and `Normalize`. Unfortunately, this change
  removes support for macOS running on Intel. Intel Mac users have the following options: A) use audiomentations 0.36.1,
  B) Create a fork of audiomentations, C) submit a patch to numpy-minmax, D) run Linux or Windows.
* Limit numpy dependency to >=1.21,<2 for now, since numpy v2 is not officially supported yet.

## [0.36.1] - 2024-08-20

### Changed

* Leverage the SIMD-accelerated [numpy-rms](https://github.com/nomonosound/numpy-rms) package for significant speed
  improvements. These transforms are faster now: `AddBackgroundNoise`, `AddColorNoise`, `AddGaussianSNR`,
  `AddShortNoises`, `Mp3Compression` and `TanhDistortion`. Unfortunately, this change removes support for Windows
  running on ARM.

## [0.36.0] - 2024-06-10

### Added

* Add support for multichannel impulse responses in `ApplyImpulseResponse`

### Changed

* :warning: `Limiter` no longer introduces delay. This is a backwards-incompatible change.
* Make `RoomSimulator` faster by avoiding unneeded calculations when the transform is not going to be applied (p<1)
* Limit scipy dependency to <1.13 because 1.13 is not compatible for now.

## [0.35.0] - 2024-03-15

### Added

* Add new transforms: `AddColorNoise`, `Aliasing` and `BitCrush`

## [0.34.1] - 2023-11-24

### Changed

* Bump min numpy version from 1.18 to 1.21
* Use numpy.typing in type hints
* Optimize max abs calculations in terms of memory and speed. This makes `Normalize`, `Mp3Compression` and `Limiter`
  slightly faster.

## [0.33.0] - 2023-08-30

### Changed

* Bump min numpy version from 1.16 to 1.18
* Bump min scipy version from 1.3 to 1.4
* Bump min python version from 3.7 to 3.8, because 3.7 is beyond end-of-life already
* Change some `AssertionError` exceptions to `ValueError`

#### :warning: The `Shift` transform has been changed:

* Removed `fade` parameter. `fade_duration=0.0` now denotes disabled fading.
* Rename `min_fraction` to `min_shift` and `max_fraction` to `max_shift`
* Add `shift_unit` parameter
* Fading is enabled by default
* Smoother fade curve

These are **breaking changes**. The following examples show how you can adapt your code when upgrading from <=v0.32.0
to >=v0.33.0:

| <= 0.32.0                                                                   | >= 0.33.0                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Shift(min_fraction=-0.5, max_fraction=0.5, fade=True, fade_duration=0.01)` | `Shift(min_shift=-0.5, max_shift=0.5, shift_unit="fraction", fade_duration=0.01)` |
| `Shift()`                                                                   | `Shift(fade_duration=0.0)`                                                        |

### Fixed

* Correct some wrong type hints

## [0.32.0] - 2023-08-15

### Added

* Add new `RepeatPart` transform

### Changed

* Bump min version of numpy dependency from 1.13 to 1.16
* If a transform is in "frozen parameters" mode, but has no parameters yet, the transform will randomize/set parameters
  when it gets called for the first time
* Increase the threshold for raising `WrongMultichannelAudioShape`. This allows some rare use cases where the number of
  channels slightly exceeds the number of samples.

### Fixed

* Fix some type hints that were `np.array` instead of `np.ndarray`

## [0.31.0] - 2023-06-21

### Changed

* Raise exception instead of warning when the given multichannel ndarray has wrong shape
* Add support for the latest librosa 0.10 version
* Switch to a faster default resampler internally in `PitchShift`, leading to much faster execution. This requires
  `soxr`.
* Bump min `scipy` requirement from 1.0 to 1.3
* Rename "_in_db" to "_db" in args and parameters. Passing args with the old names still works, but is deprecated and
  will stop working in a future version.

## [0.30.0] - 2023-05-02

### Added

* Add new `AdjustDuration` transform

### Fixed

* Fix a bug where too loud inputs got wrap distortion when running them through `Mp3Compression`

## [0.29.0] - 2023-03-15

### Added

* Add `apply_to` parameter that can be set to `"only_too_loud_sounds"` in `Normalize`

### Changed

* Change default value of `noise_rms` from `"relative"` to `"relative_to_whole_input"` in `AddShortNoises`
* Change default values of `min_snr_in_db` (from `0.0` to `-6.0`), `max_snr_in_db` (from `24.0` to `18.0`),
  `min_time_between_sounds` (from `4.0` to `2.0`) and `max_time_between_sounds` (from `16.0` to `8.0`) in
  `AddShortNoises`

### Fixed

* Fix a bug where `Limiter` raised an exception when it got digital silence as input

## [0.28.0] - 2023-01-12

### Added

* Add/improve type hints
* Add/improve documentation

### Fixed

* Fix a bug in `RoomSimulator` where the value of `max_order` was not respected

### Removed

* Remove `FrequencyMask` that had been deprecated since version 0.22.0. `BandStopFilter` is a good alternative.

## [0.27.0] - 2022-09-13

### Changed

* Speed up `Limiter` by ~8x
* Fix/improve some docstrings and type hints
* Change default values in `Trim` and `ApplyImpulseResponse` according to the warnings that were added in v0.23.0
* Emit a FutureWarning when `noise_rms` in `AddShortNoises` is not specified - the
  default value will change from "relative" to "relative_to_whole_input" in a future version.

## [0.26.0] - 2022-08-19

### Added

* Add new transform `Lambda`. Thanks to Thanatoz-1.
* Add new transform `Limiter`. Thanks to pzelasko.

### Fixed

* Fix incorrect type hints in `RoomSimulator`
* Make `Shift` robust to different sample rate inputs when parameters are frozen

## [0.25.1] - 2022-06-15

### Fixed

* Fix a bug where `RoomSimulator` would treat an x value as if it was y, and vice versa

## [0.25.0] - 2022-05-30

### Added

* Add `AirAbsorption` transform
* Add mp4 to the list of recognized audio filename extensions

### Changed

* Guard against invalid params in `TimeMask`
* Emit `FutureWarning` instead of `UserWarning` in `Trim` and `ApplyImpulseResponse`
* Allow specifying a file path, a folder path, a list of files or a list of folders to
  `ApplyImpulseResponse`, `AddBackgroundNoise` and `AddShortNoises`. Previously only a path to a folder was allowed.

### Fixed

* Fix a bug with `noise_transform` in `AddBackgroundNoise` where some
  SNR calculations were done before the `noise_transform` was applied. This has sometimes
  led to incorrect SNR in the output. **This changes the behavior** of
  `AddBackgroundNoise` (when noise_transform is used).

### Removed

* Remove support for Python 3.6, as it is past its end of life already. RIP.

## [0.24.0] - 2022-03-18

### Added

* Add `SevenBandParametricEQ` transform
* Add optional `noise_transform` in `AddShortNoises`
* Add .aac and .aif to the list of recognized audio filename endings

### Changed

* Show warning if `top_db` and/or `p` in `Trim` are not specified because their default
  values will change in a future version

### Fixed

* Fix filter instability bug related to center freq above Nyquist freq in `LowShelfFilter` and `HighShelfFilter`

## [0.23.0] - 2022-03-07

### Added

* Add `Padding` transform
* Add `RoomSimulator` transform for simulating shoebox rooms using `pyroomacoustics`
* Add parameter `signal_gain_in_db_during_noise` in `AddShortNoises`

### Changed

* Not specifying a value for `leave_length_unchanged` in `AddImpulseResponse` now emits
  a warning, as the default value will change from `False` to `True` in a future version.

### Removed

* Remove the deprecated `AddImpulseResponse` alias. Use `ApplyImpulseResponse` instead.
* Remove support for the legacy parameters `min_SNR` and `max_SNR` in `AddGaussianSNR`
* Remove useless default path value in `AddBackgroundNoise`, `AddShortNoises` and `ApplyImpulseResponse`

## [0.22.0] - 2022-02-18

### Added

* Implement `GainTransition`
* Add support for librosa 0.9
* Add support for stereo audio in `Mp3Compression`, `Resample` and `Trim`
* Add `"relative_to_whole_input"` option for `noise_rms` parameter in `AddShortNoises`
* Add optional `noise_transform` in `AddBackgroundNoise`

### Changed

* Improve speed of `PitchShift` by 6-18% when the input audio is stereo

### Deprecated

* Deprecate `FrequencyMask` in favor of `BandStopFilter`

### Removed

* Remove support for librosa<=0.7.2

## [0.21.0] - 2022-02-10

### Added

* Add support for multichannel audio in `ApplyImpulseResponse`, `BandPassFilter`, `HighPassFilter` and `LowPassFilter`
* Add `BandStopFilter` (similar to FrequencyMask, but with overhauled defaults and parameter randomization behavior),
  `PeakingFilter`, `LowShelfFilter` and `HighShelfFilter`
* Add parameter `add_all_noises_with_same_level` in `AddShortNoises`

### Changed

* Change `BandPassFilter`, `LowPassFilter`, `HighPassFilter`, to use scipy's butterworth
  filters instead of pydub. Now they have parametrized roll-off. Filters are now steeper
  than before by default - set `min_rolloff=6, max_rolloff=6` to get the old behavior.
  They also support zero-phase filtering now. And they're at least ~25x times faster than before!

### Removed

* Remove optional `wavio` dependency for audio loading

## [0.20.0] - 2021-11-18

### Added

* Implement `OneOf` and `SomeOf` for applying one of or some of many transforms. Transforms are randomly
  chosen every call. Inspired by augly. Thanks to Cangonin and iver56.
* Add a new argument `apply_to_children` (bool) in `randomize_parameters`,
  `freeze_parameters` and `unfreeze_parameters` in `Compose` and `SpecCompose`.

### Changed

* Insert three new parameters in `AddBackgroundNoise`: `noise_rms` (defaults to "relative", which is
  the old behavior), `min_absolute_rms_in_db` and `max_absolute_rms_in_db`. This **may be a breaking
  change** if you used `AddBackgroundNoise` with positional arguments in earlier versions of audiomentations!
  Please use keyword arguments to be on the safe side - it should be backwards compatible then.

### Fixed

* Remove global `pydub` import which was accidentally introduced in v0.18.0. `pydub` is
  considered an optional dependency and is imported only on demand now.

## [0.19.0] - 2021-10-18

### Added

* Implement `TanhDistortion`. Thanks to atamazian and iver56.
* Add a `noise_rms` parameter to `AddShortNoises`. It defaults to `relative`, which
  is the old behavior. `absolute` allows for adding loud noises to parts that are
  relatively silent in the input.

## [0.18.0] - 2021-08-05

### Added

* Implement `BandPassFilter`, `HighPassFilter`, `LowPassFilter` and `Reverse`. Thanks to atamazian.

## [0.17.0] - 2021-06-25

### Added

* Add a `fade` option in `Shift` for eliminating unwanted clicks
* Add support for 32-bit int wav loading with scipy>=1.6
* Add support for float64 wav files. However, the use of this format is discouraged,
  since float32 is more than enough for audio in most cases.
* Implement `Clip`. Thanks to atamazian.
* Add some parameter sanity checks in `AddGaussianNoise`
* Officially support librosa 0.8.1

### Changed

* Rename `AddImpulseResponse` to `ApplyImpulseResponse`. The former will still work for
  now, but give a warning.
* When looking for audio files in `AddImpulseResponse`, `AddBackgroundNoise`
  and `AddShortNoises`, follow symlinks by default.
* When using the new parameters `min_snr_in_db` and `max_snr_in_db` in `AddGaussianSNR`,
  SNRs will be picked uniformly in _the Decibel scale_ instead of in the linear amplitude
  ratio scale. The new behavior aligns more with human hearing, which is not linear.

### Fixed

* Avoid division by zero in `AddImpulseResponse` when input is digital silence (all zeros)
* Fix inverse SNR characteristics in `AddGaussianSNR`. It will continue working as before
  unless you switch to the new parameters `min_snr_in_db` and `max_snr_in_db`. If you
  use the old parameters, you'll get a warning.

## [0.16.0] - 2021-02-11

### Added

* Implement `SpecCompose` for applying a pipeline of spectrogram transforms. Thanks to omerferhatt.

### Fixed

* Fix a bug in `SpecChannelShuffle` where it did not support more than 3 audio channels. Thanks to omerferhatt.
* Limit scipy version range to >=1.0,<1.6 to avoid issues with loading 24-bit wav files.
  Support for scipy>=1.6 will be added later.

## [0.15.0] - 2020-12-10

### Added

* Add an option `leave_length_unchanged` to `AddImpulseResponse`

### Fixed

* Fix picklability of instances of `AddImpulseResponse`, `AddBackgroundNoise`
  and `AddShortNoises`

## [0.14.0] - 2020-12-06

### Added

* Implement `LoudnessNormalization`
* Implement `randomize_parameters` in `Compose`. Thanks to SolomidHero.
* Add multichannel support to `AddGaussianNoise`, `AddGaussianSNR`, `ClippingDistortion`,
  `FrequencyMask`, `PitchShift`, `Shift`, `TimeMask` and `TimeStretch`

## [0.13.0] - 2020-11-10

### Added

* Lay the foundation for spectrogram transforms. Implement `SpecChannelShuffle` and
  `SpecFrequencyMask`.
* Configurable LRU cache for transforms that use external sound files. Thanks to alumae.
* Officially add multichannel support to `Normalize`

### Changed

* Show a warning if a waveform had to be resampled after loading it. This is because resampling
  is slow. Ideally, files on disk should already have the desired sample rate.

### Fixed

* Correctly find audio files with upper case filename extensions.
* Fix a bug where AddBackgroundNoise crashed when trying to add digital silence to an input. Thanks to juheeuu.

## [0.12.1] - 2020-09-28

### Changed

* Speed up `AddBackgroundNoise`, `AddShortNoises` and `AddImpulseResponse` by loading wav files with scipy or wavio
  instead of librosa.

## [0.12.0] - 2020-09-23

### Added

* Implement `Mp3Compression`
* Officially support multichannel audio in `Gain` and `PolarityInversion`
* Add m4a and opus to the list of recognized audio filename extensions

### Changed

* Expand range of supported `librosa` versions

### Removed

* Python <= 3.5 is no longer officially supported,
  since [Python 3.5 has reached end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)
* Breaking change: Internal util functions are no longer exposed directly. If you were doing
  e.g. `from audiomentations import calculate_rms`, now you have to do
  `from audiomentations.core.utils import calculate_rms`

## [0.11.0] - 2020-08-27

### Added

* Implement `Gain` and `PolarityInversion`. Thanks to Spijkervet for the inspiration.

## [0.10.1] - 2020-07-27

### Changed

* Improve the performance of `AddBackgroundNoise` and `AddShortNoises` by optimizing the implementation of
  `calculate_rms`.

### Fixed

* Improve compatibility of output files written by the demo script. Thanks to xwJohn.
* Fix division by zero bug in `Normalize`. Thanks to ZFTurbo.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-05-05

### Added

* `AddImpulseResponse`, `AddBackgroundNoise` and `AddShortNoises` now support aiff files in addition to flac, mp3, ogg
  and wav

### Changed

* Breaking change: `AddImpulseResponse`, `AddBackgroundNoise` and `AddShortNoises` now include subfolders when searching
  for files. This is useful when your sound files are organized in subfolders.

### Fixed

* Fix filter instability bug in `FrequencyMask`. Thanks to kvilouras.

## [0.9.0] - 2020-02-20

### Added

* Remember randomized/chosen effect parameters. This allows for freezing the parameters and applying the same effect to
  multiple sounds. Use transform.freeze_parameters() and transform.unfreeze_parameters() for this.
* Implement transform.serialize_parameters(). Useful for when you want to store metadata on how a sound was perturbed.
* Add a rollover parameter to `Shift`. This allows for introducing silence instead of a wrapped part of the sound.
* Add support for flac in `AddImpulseResponse`
* Implement `AddBackgroundNoise` transform. Useful for when you want to add background noise to all of your sound. You
  need to give it a folder of background noises to choose from.
* Implement `AddShortNoises`. Useful for when you want to add (bursts of) short noise sounds to your input audio.

### Changed

* Disregard non-audio files when looking for impulse response files
* Switch to a faster convolve implementation. This makes `AddImpulseResponse` significantly faster.
* Expand supported range of librosa versions

### Fixed

* Fix a bug in `ClippingDistortion` where the min_percentile_threshold was not respected as expected.
* Improve handling of empty input

## [0.8.0] - 2020-01-28
